# CsgoValueCalculator
*Calculate any Steam Csgo Inventory just with SteamID or Steam profile link with your current currency.*

## Dependencies
To run the project in development mode you need to install:
- Python (I am using [v3.8.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-385/))
- Node Js
- Chrome

### Modules and librairies
You also need to install some Python and Node module like:
You can install python dependencies by using`pip install -r requirements.txt` or manually by using:
- requests: `pip install requests`
- selenium: `pip install selenium`

- ChromeDriver - You can found it [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/home)

For Node module you just need Electron for GUI:

## Setup
After installing all dependencies, you need to specify path of ChromeDriver to **csgovaluecalculator.py**
```python
 driver1 = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path='PATH TO CHROMEDRIVER', options=chrome_params)
 driver3 = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path='PATH_TO_CHROMEDRIVER', options=chrome_params)
 driver4 = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path='PATH_TO_CHROMEDRIVER', options=chrome_params)
```

```python
DISCORD_JSON_API = "YOUR DISCORD SERVER API"
